# [7.62.2](7.62.2.md)

Beginning to understand the difference in value of acquiring existing data compared to collecting new data and which is most appropriate. Does not make use of existing data. Has some awareness of licencing of data acquired from other sources but does not record licencing of acquired data alongside data sets.
