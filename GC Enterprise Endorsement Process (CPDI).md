# GC Enterprise Endorsement Process (CPDI)
- The CPDI was created in 2023 from the merging of two active and productive communities: the [Enterprise Data Community of Practice (EDCOP)](./Enterprise%20Data%20Community%20of%20Practice%20(EDCOP).md) and the [Information Management Leaders Group](./Information%20Management%20Leaders%20Group.md). These working level groups created valuable products that had nowhere to go to be deemed enterprise. This [governance - RESOURCE](./docs/governance%20-%20RESOURCE.md) process responds to that need.[^1]
- Note that there are multiple trigger points to initiate development of a solution:
	- Taskings may come from the [Assistant Deputy Ministers Committee on Data and Information (ADM CDI)](./Assistant%20Deputy%20Ministers%20Committee%20on%20Data%20and%20Information%20(ADM%20CDI).md) or the [Chief Data Officers Council (CDO Council) (CDOC)](./Chief%20Data%20Officers%20Council%20(CDO%20Council)%20(CDOC).md)
    Â 
- A [Working Group](./docs/Working%20Group.md) may seek endorsement of a [product](./docs/Product.md) it has developed on its own initiative.
