_Dear Colleagues,_[^1]

_As we continue our journey to enhance accessibility within our digital spaces, we recognize the importance of community.

_There's a world of support and knowledge beyond it. This month, we focus on accessibility communities, both within our federal public service and in the broader public sphere._

### _Communities within the public service_

_In addition to the Digital Accessibility Toolkit, several internal communities within the federal public service are dedicated to promoting accessibility. Here are three key communities:_

1. _[[CDI)](https://can01.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fgcconnex.gc.ca%2Fgroups%2Fprofile%2F42886322%2Fcentre-on-diversity-and-inclusion-cdi-centre-sur-la-diversite-et-linclusion-cdi%3Flanguage%3Den&data=05|02|wei-ju.wang%40csps-efpc.gc.ca|07097badb1304b63d52b08dcb881c94d|edc33e68da6e4071b181ce7ba461fbae|0|0|638588114773999583|Unknown|TWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D|0|||&sdata=EpuSd%2BMgvARoZSrnetZSyuWu1d%2BkXyhaxGg6Qoia3PU%3D&reserved=0|Centre on Diversity and Inclusion (CDI)]]
