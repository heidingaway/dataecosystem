# [10.90 Defining and recording accountability and ownership for data](10.90%20Defining%20and%20recording%20accountability%20and%20ownership%20for%20data.md)
# [10.90.1](10.90.1.md)

Consistent structures for ownership of data are not in place. Where ownership exists, this is assigned by default not by design. Documents responsibility and ownership of data only where externally mandated.

# [10.90.2](10.90.2.md)

Beginning to assign ownership of critical data. Documents and communicates ownership sporadically or inconsistently.

# [10.90.3](10.90.3.md)

Assigns ownership to all critical data. Documents ownership clearly and beginning to document responsibilities of data owners. Staff require specialist support to find or access this documentation.

# [10.90.4](10.90.4.md)

Assigns ownership to all critical data. Beginning to assign ownership to other important data. Clearly documents data ownership and data owners’ responsibilities in a way that is findable for all staff. Processes around this are inconsistently applied across the organisation.

# [10.90.5](10.90.5.md)

Assigns ownership to all important data. Clearly and consistently documents data ownership and data owners’ responsibilities. Ensures that this documentation is available and findable for all relevant stakeholders.
