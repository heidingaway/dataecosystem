# [3.24 Having the right tools for analysing data](3.24%20Having%20the%20right%20tools%20for%20analysing%20data.md)
# [3.24.1](3.24.1.md)

Data tools are only used for operational requirements. Analysts frequently spend time on labour-intensive workarounds to meet user needs due to inadequate analytical capability of tools.

# [3.24.2](3.24.2.md)

Tools mostly used operationally rather than analytically. May allow some basic inbuilt analysis and reporting but most often data has to be exported for analysis in another tool. Possible advanced analytical tool used for basic data processing or descriptive statistical analysis.

# [3.24.3](3.24.3.md)

Tools support efficient and effective outputs for high impact analytical processes. Efficiency and effectiveness of some lower priority outputs are still reduced due to inadequate tooling resources. Some tools may be disproportionately complex for the needs of the organisation.

# [3.24.4](3.24.4.md)

Tools for analysis are in line with the organisation’s needs and enable analysts to produce effective, efficient outputs.

# [3.24.5](3.24.5.md)

Tools that meet the peak of the organisation’s analytical needs are in place and available across the organisation. Tools for delivering batch analytics and real-time streamed data are used.
