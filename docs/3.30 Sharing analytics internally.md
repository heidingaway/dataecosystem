# [3.30.1](3.30.1.md)

Analytics tools in use are outdated and do not allow the organisation to consistently share analytics in ways that meet their usersâ€™ needs.

# [3.30.2](3.30.2.md)

Analytics tools are being updated and allow the organisation to share some analytics internally. Non-specialists are not able to meaningfully make use of analytics tools without extensive, direct support from expert users.

# [3.30.3](3.30.3.md)

Available tools allow for effective internal sharing of analytics but may not be meaningfully usable by non-specialists without support.

# [3.30.4](3.30.4.md)

Self-service analytics available both inside the organisation and to some relevant external partners and stakeholders. Non-expert users may require support from data and analysis specialists in order to make effective use of analytics.

# [3.30.5](3.30.5.md)

Self-service analytics available both inside the organisation and to relevant external partners and stakeholders. Non specialist users are able to extract meaning from analyses without support.
