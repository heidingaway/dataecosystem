# [6.52.5](6.52.5.md)

Has a clear understanding of the interactions between automation of data supply and preparation and data ethics. Proactively plans automation in processes to reduce human bias whilst carefully considering and mitigating any bias the automation could introduce. Plans for oversight, transparency, and public scrutiny from the beginning in all data processing automation initiatives. Documents all changes to these processes and the reasons for the changes clearly and consistently across the organisation.
