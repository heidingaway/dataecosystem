# [8.82.3](8.82.3.md)

Standardised processes for recording IT assets are in place. Value and sensitivity of data stored in these assets is not consistently recorded. Security risks to all known IT assets are assessed and addressed. Physical security for high priority assets is reviewed regularly, however the security implemented is not measured in relation to the value or sensitivity of the data.
