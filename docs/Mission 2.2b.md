TBS will set expectations and work with StatCan and others to enable data discovery, integration and reuse through the review and development of information management and data policy instruments such as the Treasury Board Standard on Metadata, development of a FAIR principles (Findability, Accessibility, Interoperability and Reusability) assessment tool, and guidance on assessment of existing data for reuse
