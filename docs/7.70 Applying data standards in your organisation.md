# [7.70 Applying data standards in your organisation](7.70%20Applying%20data%20standards%20in%20your%20organisation.md)
# [7.70.1](7.70.1.md)

Applies data standards only where they are externally mandated for compliance. Considers interoperability between data sets only to mitigate against critical failures.

# [7.70.2](7.70.2.md)

Beginning to apply data standards on an ad hoc basis where interoperability between data sets is needed for a specific purpose.

# [7.70.3](7.70.3.md)

Applies data standards in some areas but does so inconsistently. Some data is versatile and re-usable internally for limited purposes.

# [7.70.4](7.70.4.md)

Beginning to apply data standards consistently enough to allow data to be re-used internally for a range of purposes. Some data is re-usable externally but with limited scope.

# [7.70.5](7.70.5.md)

Applies data standards consistently across the organisation to ensure that data is versatile and re-usable for multiple purposes and audiences.
