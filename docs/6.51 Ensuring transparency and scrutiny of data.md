# [6.51.1](6.51.1.md)

Complies with minimum legal requirements for transparency and public oversight of data use. These requirements are considered at a late stage of projects and usually met as an after thought.

# [6.51.2](6.51.2.md)

Beginning to recognise the potential for increasing transparency and public oversight of the organisationâ€™s data objectives, but no firm or structured plans. Where this occurs, it is driven by internal engagement.

# [6.51.3](6.51.3.md)

Beginning to consider public visibility and oversight as a core element of high profile data initiatives. Engagement with some users to improve transparency occurs in isolated pockets of the organisation.

# [6.51.4](6.51.4.md)

Engages with users to ensure appropriate transparency and accountability in structured ways. Some parts of the organisation consistently consider how to ensure appropriate public visibility from the start when planning data initiatives.

# [6.51.5](6.51.5.md)

Actively engages with appropriate communities to empower the public to hold the organisation to account on their data objectives. Considerations of public visibility are integral to planning new data initiatives.
