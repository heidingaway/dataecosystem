# [4.36.4](4.36.4.md)

Includes information in metadata regarding why the data set was created or acquired, and the purposes and users for which the data set was created. Marks sensitivity of data in critical data sets, but this may be inconsistent across the organisation. Standardises metadata based on some understanding of user needs.
