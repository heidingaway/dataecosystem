# [3.27 Planning effectively to ensure adequate tools for data](3.27%20Planning%20effectively%20to%20ensure%20adequate%20tools%20for%20data.md)
# [3.27.1](3.27.1.md)

Dedicates resources to tools, systems and infrastructure for data only when critical systems fail or when changes are legally required.

# [3.27.2](3.27.2.md)

Acquires systems and tools on a ‘needs-must’ basis, eg for a specific, isolated purpose or project, or when the existing systems and tools fail.

# [3.27.3](3.27.3.md)

Primarily acquires systems and tools as ‘one-offs’ for specific purposes with limited flexibility for change or improvement. Considers replacements for all critical systems and tools, and researches and costs this before they fail. Dedicates some resources to improving software tools and ad-hoc hardware replacement.

# [3.27.4](3.27.4.md)

Commits resources to new and existing systems and tools across the organisation, but the approach is inconsistent. Proactively considers and costs replacements and upgrades for all critical and some important systems and tools.

# [3.27.5](3.27.5.md)

Commits resources to new and existing systems and tools across the organisation, with a consistent, coordinated approach across the organisation. Proactively considers and costs replacements and upgrades for all critical and important systems and tools.
