# [6.52.3](6.52.3.md)

Consistently considers risks and benefits of automation of data supply and processing and in high profile areas. Understands where automation is proportionate, and mitigates against the potential for automation to introduce bias, though somewhat inconsistently in different areas of the organisation. Consistently considers oversight, transparency, and public scrutiny of automated data processing, but does so at a late stage. Documentation of changes is sporadic.
