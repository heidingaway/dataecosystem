# Foresight on AI Policy considerations

## Abstract
Artificial intelligence (AI) is a game-changing technology. The pace of advancement in this field
has led to several impressive developments over the past decade and notable advancements in
the past year. As AI developers release an increasing number of new technologies into the world, uncertainty and ambiguity surrounding its impacts—whether positive or negative—are growing. The increased speed of innovation today, compared to the past, also means that technological developments frequently outpace the ability of laws and regulations to keep up.

This report lays out fifteen insights about factors that could shape the evolution of AI, in terms of
technical capabilities, adoption and use. By exploring factors shaping the future of AI, public
servants can seek to understand the impacts AI could have on governance, society, and the
market.

This is the second iteration of a report produced by Policy Horizons Canada’s Interdepartmental
project on the future of AI. It is a complement to AI-related work across the Government of
Canada and aims to help decision makers reflect on the future of AI, focusing on elements that
are beyond the radar and beyond the horizon.[^1]
