# [5.44.4](5.44.4.md)

Regularly reviews and adapts services, products and campaigns in response to data to optimise outcomes. Designs services to ensure inclusion and protection for societal groups who could be negatively impacted by the organisationâ€™s data. Applies this somewhat inconsistently across different areas of the organisation.
