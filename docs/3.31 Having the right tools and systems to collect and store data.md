# [3.31 Having the right tools and systems to collect and store data](3.31%20Having%20the%20right%20tools%20and%20systems%20to%20collect%20and%20store%20data.md)
# [3.31.1](3.31.1.md)

Mostly uses unstructured tools and systems to collect data such as emails, SMS messages, paper forms. Does not consistently transfer this data into a structured physical or digital storage system.

# [3.31.2](3.31.2.md)

Mostly collects data manually and then enters it into an isolated database or spreadsheet for analysis and reporting.

# [3.31.3](3.31.3.md)

Holds data in a range of systems and tools that are all separately managed. Interlinking between systems is restricted by default rather than by design.

# [3.31.4](3.31.4.md)

Collects and automatically stores data digitally wherever possible eg online forms or apps directly into databases. Beginning to break down silos by increasing interlinking between systems and tools.

# [3.31.5](3.31.5.md)

Has capacity to store, manage, and analyse increasingly large volumes of data from multiple sources. Breaks down silos by increasing interlinking between data storage systems and tools with appropriately managed access.
