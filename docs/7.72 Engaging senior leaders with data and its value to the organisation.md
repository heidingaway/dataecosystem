# [7.72 Engaging senior leaders with data and its value to the organisation](7.72%20Engaging%20senior%20leaders%20with%20data%20and%20its%20value%20to%20the%20organisation.md)
# [7.72.1](7.72.1.md)

Leaders are not engaged with data or how it is used. They do not understand how difficult or complex it is to achieve their requests for data.

# [7.72.2](7.72.2.md)

Leaders are aware of some uses for data in the organisation but do not see value in it for business outcomes. Leaders do not see data as a priority in the organisation.

# [7.72.3](7.72.3.md)

Leaders occasionally ask questions about the data they are given but are not entirely convinced about its value. Leaders have little or no interest in the full data lifecycle.

# [7.72.4](7.72.4.md)

Leaders are beginning to engage with the value of data throughout the data lifecycle. They ask the right questions of data, are active in harnessing its value, and supportive of the organisation’s data needs.

# [7.72.5](7.72.5.md)

Leaders are fully engaged with the value of data at all stages of the data lifecycle. They proactively seek to understand the organisation’s current and future data needs.
