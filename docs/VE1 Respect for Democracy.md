The system of Canadian parliamentary democracy and its institutions are fundamental to serving the public interest. Public servants recognize that elected officials are accountable to Parliament, and ultimately to the Canadian people, and that a non-partisan public sector is essential to our democratic system.

Public servants shall uphold the Canadian parliamentary democracy and its institutions by:
# [VE1.1](VE1.1.md)
Respecting the rule of law and carrying out their duties in accordance with legislation, policies and directives in a non-partisan and impartial manner.

# [VE1.2](VE1.2.md)
Loyally carrying out the lawful decisions of their leaders and supporting ministers in their accountability to Parliament and Canadians.

# [VE1.3](VE1.3.md)
Providing decision makers with all the information, analysis and advice they need, always striving to be open, candid and impartial.
