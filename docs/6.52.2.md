# [6.52.2](6.52.2.md)

Beginning to consider how to use automation in high profile areas of data supply and processing. Beginning to consider how to mitigate against automation risks in high profile areas, however does so inconsistently and usually after the implementation. Beginning to consider oversight, transparency and routes for public scrutiny when automating data processing. Does not document changes to these processes.
