# [3.29 Sharing data internally](3.29%20Sharing%20data%20internally.md)
# [3.29.1](3.29.1.md)

Users are not able to find or access data that they need due to inadequate data storage tools. Access to stored data is not managed, or is managed ad hoc without structured processes.

# [3.29.2](3.29.2.md)

Some people or teams may use cloud-based document storage to share some data. Access is managed ad hoc on an individual level by staff who may not be specially trained in security and governance.

# [3.29.3](3.29.3.md)

Data storage tools are beginning to be used that allow for broader, internal sharing across the organisation. Access to data for non-experts may require specialist support.

# [3.29.4](3.29.4.md)

Data storage tools allow for internal sharing across the organisation, with internal and external access managed appropriately. Tools in use in some areas of the organisation are not proportionate to data and analytical needs. Non-experts are able to access most data without specialist support.

# [3.29.5](3.29.5.md)

Data storage and sharing tools are proportionate to analytical capability and data needs. Storage tools allow for non-experts to access appropriate data without requiring specialist support. Internal and external access is managed appropriately.
