# [4.36.5](4.36.5.md)

Actively maintains and updates metadata in tandem with changes to the data for all known data sets. Supports prevention of mosaic re-identification when combined with other data in archives by marking sensitivity of data clearly. Standardises metadata based on an in-depth understanding of user and data needs.
