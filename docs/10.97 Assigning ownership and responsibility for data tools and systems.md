# [10.97 Assigning ownership and responsibility for data tools and systems](10.97%20Assigning%20ownership%20and%20responsibility%20for%20data%20tools%20and%20systems.md)
# [10.97.1](10.97.1.md)

Holds a minimal record of some tools used or owned by the organisation. Any records are usually collected indirectly without organisation or coherent structure. Only creates structures of responsibility for maintaining and updating tools by default rather than by design.

# [10.97.2](10.97.2.md)

An inventory of tools and systems (including hardware, software, licence, passwords and access) is managed and maintained. Ownership and responsibility for tools and systems is not consistently recorded.

# [10.97.3](10.97.3.md)

Formal responsibility for data and analytics tools is established, however this is not well monitored or visible across the organisation. Staff do not understand how these structures relate to their work.

# [10.97.4](10.97.4.md)

People are formally responsible for managing the storage, cleaning and maintenance, security, and backup of all data. Where possible this is becoming routine and/or automated.

# [10.97.5](10.97.5.md)

Ownership, oversight and support for all tools is documented. Accountability and responsibility for tools is transparent and visible across the organisation. Staff understand how these structures relate to their work.
