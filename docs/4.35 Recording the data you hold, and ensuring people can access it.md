# [4.35.1](4.35.1.md)

Has no formal record of the data that the organisation holds. Nobody is aware or interested in the data assets in the organisation.

# [4.35.2](4.35.2.md)

Has a basic register of data assets. The process for how to record data in the register is not described, supported or monitored. There is no public layer to the records and the register cannot be accessed by those who need it.

# [4.35.3](4.35.3.md)

Has a register of data assets with standardised processes. The register can be accessed by request at the discretion of the accountable party with no consistent, communicated process in place for this.

# [4.35.4](4.35.4.md)

Has a comprehensive and standardised register of data assets with efficient and appropriately governed internal access. Exploring processes for a public access layer for transparency of the nature assets held by the organisation that cannot be accessed directly, but this may be poorly communicated.

# [4.35.5](4.35.5.md)

Has a comprehensive, standardised, and visible register of data assets with efficient and appropriately governed internal and external access. A public access layer supports transparency around data assets that require limited access.
