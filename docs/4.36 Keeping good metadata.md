# [4.36 Keeping good metadata](4.36%20Keeping%20good%20metadata.md)
# [4.36.1](4.36.1.md)

Has metadata for some data sets. Where metadata is present it is often incomplete or out of date.

# [4.36.2](4.36.2.md)

Has metadata for most high priority data sets, however it may be incomplete and is not updated in tandem with changes to the data. Metadata does not account for user needs.

# [4.36.3](4.36.3.md)

Includes information in metadata regarding where and when the data was collected or acquired, accounting for licencing that may affect long-term preservation. Metadata format and structure is standardised to some degree.

# [4.36.4](4.36.4.md)

Includes information in metadata regarding why the data set was created or acquired, and the purposes and users for which the data set was created. Marks sensitivity of data in critical data sets, but this may be inconsistent across the organisation. Standardises metadata based on some understanding of user needs.

# [4.36.5](4.36.5.md)

Actively maintains and updates metadata in tandem with changes to the data for all known data sets. Supports prevention of mosaic re-identification when combined with other data in archives by marking sensitivity of data clearly. Standardises metadata based on an in-depth understanding of user and data needs.
