# [9.85 Linking data principles and policies to organisational objectives](9.85%20Linking%20data%20principles%20and%20policies%20to%20organisational%20objectives.md)
# [9.85.1](9.85.1.md)

Links data objectives, data principles, and data policies to organisational objectives only to minimum degrees required by externally enforced mandates.

# [9.85.2](9.85.2.md)

Beginning to see value in linking data objectives to organisational objectives. Attempts to do so are limited in scope and do not consistently surface in data policies or data principles.

# [9.85.3](9.85.3.md)

Beginning to consistently link data objectives to organisational objectives, though this may not always be made clear in organisational plans. Some of this may surface in data policies or data principles, but the links are not explicit.

# [9.85.4](9.85.4.md)

Leaders have clear sight of how and why data objectives, data principles and data policies link to organisational objectives. These links surface in data policies and data principles, but the approach is somewhat inconsistent.

# [9.85.5](9.85.5.md)

Leaders proactively work to ensure that data objectives are aligned with organisational objectives. Clearly and consistently aligns data principles, data policies, and data strategy with organisational strategy.
