Senior leaders are engaged with ensuring oversight and scrutiny is in place for the ethical use of data across the organisation. Lines of responsibility and accountability for data ethics are structured, though visibility of this may be limited. Champions for data ethics are present in the organisation, however they may lack the seniority or the reach to have a large impact.
