# [6.47 Accounting for limitations in data and how this may introduce bias](6.47%20Accounting%20for%20limitations%20in%20data%20and%20how%20this%20may%20introduce%20bias.md)
# [6.47.1](6.47.1.md)

Only accounts for how limitations in data that may create bias and negatively affect particular groups where it is externally mandated by legal, policy, or service level agreement requirements.

# [6.47.2](6.47.2.md)

Beginning to account for how limitations in some high profile data sets may introduce bias that can negatively affect any particular groups. This occurs inconsistently in small pockets of the organisation.

# [6.47.3](6.47.3.md)

Accounts for limitations in all high profile data sets that may introduce bias and negatively affect any particular groups. This may be inconsistent across different areas of the organisation.

# [6.47.4](6.47.4.md)

Accounts for limitations in all high profile data sets and some important data sets that may introduce bias. This occurs consistently for high profile areas, but pockets of the organisation still struggle to apply this consistently.

# [6.47.5](6.47.5.md)

Proactively considers how limitations in all high profile and important data sets may introduce bias. A consistent approach is taken across the organisation to ensure that limitations to data do not negatively impact any particular groups.
