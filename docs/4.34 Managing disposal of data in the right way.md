# [4.34 Managing disposal of data in the right way](4.34%20Managing%20disposal%20of%20data%20in%20the%20right%20way.md)
# [4.34.1](4.34.1.md)

Complies with minimum legal requirements for archiving of data. Disposal of data is ad hoc and does not consider the value or retention needs of the data.

# [4.34.2](4.34.2.md)

Plans for organised disposal of data, but does not consider different value and sensitivity of data or retention needs for different data sets. Consistently records established processes for disposal of data and ownership of those processes.

# [4.34.3](4.34.3.md)

Links the retention period for data in high profile data assets to the long-term value, sensitivity and context of the data. Records processes for disposal of the data alongside the data asset.

# [4.34.4](4.34.4.md)

Automates disposal of data in line with legal requirements and the long-term value of the data. Documents processes for data disposal clearly, and reviews them in tandem with changes to the data.

# [4.34.5](4.34.5.md)

Proactively considers the requirements and processes for end-of-lifecycle disposal of data at the beginning of the data lifecycle. Consistently balances user needs with requirements for long-term preservation of data when implementing data initiatives.
