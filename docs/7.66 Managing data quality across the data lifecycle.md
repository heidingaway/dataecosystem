# [7.66 Managing data quality across the data lifecycle](7.66%20Managing%20data%20quality%20across%20the%20data%20lifecycle.md)
# [7.66.1](7.66.1.md)

Makes efforts to manage data quality only when it is externally mandated by legal, policy, or service level agreement requirements. Does not make dedicated resources available for this.

# [7.66.2](7.66.2.md)

Manages data quality ad hoc and at a late stage in the data lifecycle. Where resources and processes are in place for managing data quality, they focus only on data cleaning.

# [7.66.3](7.66.3.md)

Beginning to manage data quality for priority data at different stages of the data lifecycle.

# [7.66.4](7.66.4.md)

Puts resources and processes in place for managing data quality at all stages of the data lifecycle, but does not apply this consistently across the organisation.

# [7.66.5](7.66.5.md)

Proactively invests in resources to collect, maintain, and manage high quality data at all stages of the data lifecycle. Data quality is managed consistently across the organisation.
