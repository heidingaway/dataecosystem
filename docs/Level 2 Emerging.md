Beginning to explore how to share data more effectively and make data publicly available. Aware of trade off between openness and security.

# [1.3.2](1.3.2.md)

Makes changes to data without considering users’ needs or how the changes will affect the users. Communicates changes to high profile data. The approach and format of communication is inconsistent.

# [1.4.2](1.4.2.md)

Sees data sharing primarily as task, not as strategy. Beginning to become more open to data sharing in some pockets of the organisation.

Beginning to form a culture of openness and learning from mistakes. Makes some efforts to communicate lessons learned in an ad hoc way.

# [1.6.2](1.6.2.md)

Engages with some internal users of the organisation’s data to know what their needs are. Beginning to act on this in some high profile areas.

# [1.7.2](1.7.2.md)

Engages with some external users of the organisation’s data to know what their needs are. Beginning to act on this in some high profile areas.

# [1.8.2](1.8.2.md)

Beginning to engage internally to improve awareness of government support teams and networks, but this is limited in scope to small groups of highly specialised staff. Individual staff working with data may engage with these informally and infrequently.

# [2.9.2](2.9.2.md)

Most staff recognise data is part of the organisation’s operation but are not aware of how it relates to their work.

# [2.10.2](2.10.2.md)

Routinely shares some appropriate data sets with appropriate assessments in place. Understands the legal and security concerns around sharing data and beginning to weigh business needs with privacy and security concerns appropriately in some data.

# [2.11.2](2.11.2.md)

Leaders are beginning to question how the organisation’s data management practices support its business outcomes. Data initiatives are carried out without explicitly linking to outcomes that the data supports.

# [2.12.2](2.12.2.md)

Senior business leaders have a basic level of knowledge or some experience of data and analytics. Some leaders are capable of making use of analyses and data with some specialist support.

# [2.13.2](2.13.2.md)

Beginning to see value in data and analytical skills as part of business leadership. However, data and analytical literacy in senior leadership remains limited.

# [2.14.2](2.14.2.md)

Provides training for to improve data skills in an ad hoc way or on a localised basis. This is limited to a small group of highly specialised staff.

# [2.15.2](2.15.2.md)

Data literacy is patchy, mostly low, amongst staff. Basic or adequate skills and training in using data for operational and administrative purposes.

# [2.16.2](2.16.2.md)

Individual staff working with data are aware of some internal or external data communities of practice and some learning opportunities. Staff may engage with these informally based on personal interest.

# [2.17.2](2.17.2.md)

Different staff collect, manage and use data as part of their roles without coordinated, consistent responsibilities assigned to roles. Beginning to consider some training or specialisation, but with minimal commitment to change.

# [2.18.2](2.18.2.md)

Beginning to consider different options when addressing skill gaps but decisions are not always clearly linked to the organisation’s long and short terms needs.

# [2.19.2](2.19.2.md)

Small groups of specialist staff working with data have access to specialised data training. The approach is ad hoc and uncoordinated. Awareness and documentation of specialist data skills amongst staff across the organisation is poor.

# [2.20.2](2.20.2.md)

Beginning to provide some limited, internal training for basic, ‘adequate’ data skills, though staff mostly learn through experience.

# [2.21.2](2.21.2.md)

Beginning to understand needs around data skills and capabilities.

# [2.22.2](2.22.2.md)

Manually reworks data for presentation in written reports for different internal and external audiences.

# [3.23.2](3.23.2.md)

Leaders seek to improve or replace data systems and tools reactively when insufficient systems and tools have damaged organisational outcomes.

# [3.24.2](3.24.2.md)

Tools mostly used operationally rather than analytically. May allow some basic inbuilt analysis and reporting but most often data has to be exported for analysis in another tool. Possible advanced analytical tool used for basic data processing or descriptive statistical analysis.

# [3.25.2](3.25.2.md)

Most tools for organising and accessing data allow for the organisation to meet its objectives. Some tools may be disproportionate to the organisation’s needs.

Understands what data tools are in use and provides basic support for high priority tools. Invests in updating tools only when out of date tools begin to have negative impacts on outcomes.

# [3.29.2](3.29.2.md)

Some people or teams may use cloud-based document storage to share some data. Access is managed ad hoc on an individual level by staff who may not be specially trained in security and governance.

# [3.30.2](3.30.2.md)

Analytics tools are being updated and allow the organisation to share some analytics internally. Non-specialists are not able to meaningfully make use of analytics tools without extensive, direct support from expert users.

Mostly collects data manually and then enters it into an isolated database or spreadsheet for analysis and reporting.

# [3.32.2](3.32.2.md)

Documents critical data sets in a central location, with a location of the data set. Relies on ad hoc processes or substantial specialist support to make data available to those who need it.

# [4.34.2](4.34.2.md)

Plans for organised disposal of data, but does not consider different value and sensitivity of data or retention needs for different data sets. Consistently records established processes for disposal of data and ownership of those processes.

# [4.35.2](4.35.2.md)

Has a basic register of data assets. The process for how to record data in the register is not described, supported or monitored. There is no public layer to the records and the register cannot be accessed by those who need it.

# [4.36.2](4.36.2.md)

Has metadata for most high priority data sets, however it may be incomplete and is not updated in tandem with changes to the data. Metadata does not account for user needs.

Starting to use data to inform efficiency savings. Does not frequently use data to influence strategic decisions.

# [6.48.2](6.48.2.md)

Ensures transparency around most high profile processing and analysis of data where appropriate.

# [6.54.2](6.54.2.md)

Considers data ethics, but faces difficulty in doing so with depth or breadth due to a lack of diversity in the organisation’s leadership.

# [6.55.2](6.55.2.md)

Senior leaders are beginning to engage with ensuring external and public oversight and scrutiny is in place for the ethical use of data. However, their approach is unstructured or reactive.

Leaders show some recognition of the importance of data to the organisation, but they do not see the value of engaging with it.

# [9.87.2](9.87.2.md)
