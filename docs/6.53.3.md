# [6.53.3](6.53.3.md)

Embeds transparency of methods into the process when designing data collection where appropriate. Makes efforts from the beginning to mitigate bias and make collection methods accessible to ensure that no societal group is disadvantaged by the methods used. Applies this very inconsistently in different areas of the organisation.
