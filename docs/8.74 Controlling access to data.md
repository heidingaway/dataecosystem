# [8.74 Controlling access to data](8.74%20Controlling%20access%20to%20data.md)
# [8.74.1](8.74.1.md)

Data security in place only to meet minimum legal or policy requirements. Does not link security vetting of staff to data protection and data security measures.

# [8.74.2](8.74.2.md)

Most critical systems, processes, and data have limited security and security governance. Security vetting of some staff is linked to data security.

# [8.74.3](8.74.3.md)

All critical data assets have at least limited security and security governance in place. Security vetting of most staff is linked to data security.

# [8.74.4](8.74.4.md)

Consistent and comprehensive security and security governance policies are in place for all critical data assets. Clearly links security vetting and background checks of all staff to data security and legitimate business need.

# [8.74.5](8.74.5.md)

Communicates security governance clearly and openly throughout the organisation. Clearly links security vetting and background checks of all staff to data security and legitimate business need. Reflects security clearance for access to data assets in employment contracts where appropriate.
