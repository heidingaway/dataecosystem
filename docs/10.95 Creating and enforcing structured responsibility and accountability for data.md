# [10.95 Creating and enforcing structured responsibility and accountability for data](10.95%20Creating%20and%20enforcing%20structured%20responsibility%20and%20accountability%20for%20data.md)
# [10.95.1](10.95.1.md)

# [10.95.2](10.95.2.md)

# [10.95.3](10.95.3.md)
Leaders monitor adherence to data and analysis policies and processes and enforce where necessary.
# [10.95.4](10.95.4.md)
Leaders are invested in ensuring that responsibility, accountability and oversight for data is structured, maintained, and enforced.
# [10.95.5](10.95.5.md)
Has transparent and well-communicated structures for responsibility, accountability and oversight for data across the organisation. Leaders ensure that staff have a clear understanding of how this relates to their own work.
