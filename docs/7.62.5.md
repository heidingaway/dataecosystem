# [7.62.5](7.62.5.md)

Has a clear understanding of the value of using existing data rather than collecting new data and which is most appropriate. Makes full use of open data sets where appropriate and fully embeds the approach from beginning to end. Fully records licencing of data acquired from other sources and this approach is fully embedded from beginning to end. Plans for effects of licencing on long-term preservation of data sets containing acquired data and this approach is fully embedded from beginning to end.
