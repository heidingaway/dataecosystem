# [9.87 Linking data strategy to organisational strategy](9.87%20Linking%20data%20strategy%20to%20organisational%20strategy.md)
# [9.87.1](9.87.1.md)

Links data strategy to organisational strategy only where it is required for external reporting purposes. Any connections are not acted on internally. Leaders do not see data as a priority.

# [9.87.2](9.87.2.md)

Beginning to see the relevance of data strategy to organisational strategy, but does not attempt to connect these for internal action. Sees data as useful, but not a high priority.

# [9.87.3](9.87.3.md)

Leaders see data as important to organisational outcomes. Beginning to incorporate data strategy in organisational strategies but this may be inconsistent or disjointed.

# [9.87.4](9.87.4.md)

Leaders see data as a priority. Prioritises and plans data strategy as part of organisational strategy, though application may not be consistent across the organisation. Data strategy has sponsorship at a senior level.

# [9.87.5](9.87.5.md)

Consistently sees data as a vital resource for the organisation. Plans and prioritises data strategy as a core element of organisational strategy. Sponsorship and promotion of this by senior leaders is visible and communicated.
