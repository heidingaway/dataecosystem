# [3.25 Having the right tools for organising and accessing data](3.25%20Having%20the%20right%20tools%20for%20organising%20and%20accessing%20data.md)
# [3.25.1](3.25.1.md)

Uses tools for accessing and organising data that are highly disproportionate to the organisation’s needs. Reviews tools when failures have had a substantial negative impact on outcomes.

# [3.25.2](3.25.2.md)

Most tools for organising and accessing data allow for the organisation to meet its objectives. Some tools may be disproportionate to the organisation’s needs.

# [3.25.3](3.25.3.md)

Tools for organising and accessing data are proportionate to the organisation’s needs and allow for registers of data assets to be maintained and updated.

# [3.25.4](3.25.4.md)

Regularly reviews tools for organising and accessing data to ensure they are adequate and proportionate for current and short-term future needs. Some awareness of tools that might be relevant to the organisation in the future, but interest and buy-in at senior levels is limited.

# [3.25.5](3.25.5.md)

Makes use of horizon scanning for emerging technology. Understands what future tools are relevant and proportionate to the organisation’s needs.
