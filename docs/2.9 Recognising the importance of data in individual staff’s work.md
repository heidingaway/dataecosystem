# [2.9.1](2.9.1.md)

Awareness of data across the organisation is low or non-existent. Very few staff see how data relates to their work.

# [2.9.2](2.9.2.md)

Most staff recognise data is part of the organisation’s operation but are not aware of how it relates to their work.

# [2.9.3](2.9.3.md)

People across the organisation are starting to talk about data and beginning to understand how it relates to their work.

# [2.9.4](2.9.4.md)

Data advocacy may be present in high value data management or analytical areas of the organisation to support embedding of awareness of data. The approach to this may be unstructured and inconsistent across the organisation.

# [2.9.5](2.9.5.md)

Data advocacy is present in each area of the organisation to actively promote and maintain embedded data awareness across the organisation. The organisation proactively embeds into networks of data knowledge and research in the context of its work.
