# [3.32 Storing data in organised ways](3.32%20Storing%20data%20in%20organised%20ways.md)
# [3.32.1](3.32.1.md)

Data is disorganised and unmanaged and stored in a range of places: on desks, in filing cabinets, individual peopleâ€™s email inboxes, computers, phones, or other devices.

# [3.32.2](3.32.2.md)

Stores most data in designated locations. Data is stored in hardcopy and digital formats. Accessing the data requires physical presence in those designated locations. Organisation and management of stored data is ad hoc or manual.

# [3.32.3](3.32.3.md)

Mostly stores important digital data on a secure, backed-up environment such as a cloud-based system or local server with managed access. Some data may remain inaccessible on computers, central shared drives or devices.

# [3.32.4](3.32.4.md)

Stores all important data relevant to important business operations and outcomes in secure, backed-up digital systems with managed access where possible.

# [3.32.5](3.32.5.md)

Draws data from a streamlined number of sub-databases and systems. Holds data in properly supported, securely accessed databases
