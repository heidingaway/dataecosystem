# [7.62.4](7.62.4.md)

Understands the value of using existing data rather than collecting new data and which is most appropriate. Makes good use of open data sets where appropriate but does not fully embed the approach from beginning to end. Records and communicates licencing of data acquired from other sources but this approach is not fully embedded from beginning to end. Plans for effects of licencing on long-term preservation of data sets containing acquired data but this approach is not fully embedded from beginning to end.
