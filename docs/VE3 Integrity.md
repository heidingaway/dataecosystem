# [VE3 Integrity](VE3%20Integrity.md)

Integrity is the cornerstone of good governance and democracy. By upholding the highest ethical standards, public servants conserve and enhance public confidence in the honesty, fairness and impartiality of the federal public sector.

Public servants shall serve the public interest by:
# [VE3.1](VE3.1.md)
Acting at all times with integrity and in a manner that will bear the closest public scrutiny, an obligation that may not be fully satisfied by simply acting within the law.

# [VE3.2](VE3.2.md)
Never using their official roles to inappropriately obtain an advantage for themselves or to advantage or disadvantage others.

# [VE3.3](VE3.3.md)
Taking all possible steps to prevent and resolve any real, apparent or potential conflicts of interest between their official responsibilities and their private affairs in favour of the public interest.

# [VE3.4](VE3.4.md)
Acting in such a way as to maintain their employer’s trust.
