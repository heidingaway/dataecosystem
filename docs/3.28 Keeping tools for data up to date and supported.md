# [3.28 Keeping tools for data up to date and supported](3.28%20Keeping%20tools%20for%20data%20up%20to%20date%20and%20supported.md)
# [3.28.1](3.28.1.md)

Does not understand what data tools are in use. Provides minimal, ad hoc support for tools. Invests in updating tools only when out of date tools have had substantial negative impacts on outcomes.

# [3.28.2](3.28.2.md)

Understands what data tools are in use and provides basic support for high priority tools. Invests in updating tools only when out of date tools begin to have negative impacts on outcomes.

# [3.28.3](3.28.3.md)

Most data tools are up to date with support available. Work-arounds for inadequate tools to mitigate negative impacts on outcomes are not well communicated or understood.

# [3.28.4](3.28.4.md)

Most data tools are up to date with support available. Communicates some work-arounds for inadequate tools, but inconsistently. Actively plans replacements for poorer tools.

# [3.28.5](3.28.5.md)

All data tools are up to date and have adequate support in place. Consistently records and communicates work-arounds for inadequate tools, with a proactive, structured approach to replacing poorer tools.
