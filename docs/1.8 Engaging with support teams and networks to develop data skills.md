# [1.8.1](1.8.1.md)

Sees little or no value in engaging with others to develop staff data literacy.

# [1.8.2](1.8.2.md)

Beginning to engage internally to improve awareness of government support teams and networks, but this is limited in scope to small groups of highly specialised staff. Individual staff working with data may engage with these informally and infrequently.

# [1.8.3](1.8.3.md)

The organisation makes deliberate and planned engagements with government support teams and networks to develop data literacy. Frequency of engagement is ad hoc, based on specific needs.

# [1.8.4](1.8.4.md)

Embeds regular engagement with government support teams and networks in working practices. Keeps up to date with developments in the field as part of ongoing commitment to data literacy.

# [1.8.5](1.8.5.md)

Becoming experts that other partners, peers and departments use as a resource.
