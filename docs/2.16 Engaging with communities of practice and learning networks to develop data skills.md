Sees little or no value in engaging with internal or external data learning networks or communities of practice to develop staff data literacy.

# [2.16.2](2.16.2.md)

Embeds structured engagement with data learning networks and communities of practice across the organisation. Makes this visible to all staff.

# [2.16.5](2.16.5.md)
