# [2.16.1](2.16.1.md)

Sees little or no value in engaging with internal or external data learning networks or communities of practice to develop staff data literacy.

# [2.16.2](2.16.2.md)

Individual staff working with data are aware of some internal or external data communities of practice and some learning opportunities. Staff may engage with these informally based on personal interest.

# [2.16.3](2.16.3.md)

Sees engagement with internal or external data communities of practice as valuable, but this is limited to specialist staff. Continues to engage on an ad hoc basis rather than a continuous basis.

# [2.16.4](2.16.4.md)

Embeds structured engagement with data learning networks and communities of practice across the organisation. Makes this visible to all staff.

# [2.16.5](2.16.5.md)

Actively participating or leading within data learning networks and in communities of practice. Exploring new tools and skills.
