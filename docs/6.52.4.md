# [6.52.4](6.52.4.md)

Consistently considers the risks and benefits of automation in all high profile areas, and beginning to do so in other areas. Understands where automation is proportionate, mitigates risks appropriately, and plans to do so from early stages for all processes, though this may be inconsistent across the organisation. Considers oversight, transparency, and public scrutiny from early stages of automation initiatives, and consistently documents all changes.
