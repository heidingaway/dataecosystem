# [10.91 Creating and embedding data governance](10.91%20Creating%20and%20embedding%20data%20governance.md)
# [10.91.1](10.91.1.md)

Only has governance systems in place for sharing and use of data in line with externally driven requirements. Struggles to use or share data within the organisation due to lack of clarity on what is possible.

# [10.91.2](10.91.2.md)

There is a policy or framework for governance of data in place, but this is not understood, known or possible to implement.

# [10.91.3](10.91.3.md)

People are aware of governance frameworks, systems and accountabilities. These have been developed with the needs of the organisation in mind.

# [10.91.4](10.91.4.md)

Robust, needs-based governance frameworks are embedded in the organisation.

# [10.91.5](10.91.5.md)

Governance for use and sharing of data is fully embedded. Governance, ownership and accountability for analysis are well documented and enforced, and clearly visible across the organisation. Analysts understand how their work relates to these structures.
