Has identified the data that can be shared. Has appropriate assessments and licencing in place for all shared data sets.

# [2.11.3](2.11.3.md)

Leaders understand how good data management supports business outcomes. Data initiatives may not be consistently linked to all of the outcomes that the data supports.

# [2.12.3](2.12.3.md)

# [3.23.3](3.23.3.md)

Leaders dedicate some resources to improving or replacing data systems and tools, before poor tools damage organisational outcomes. This generally occurs on an ad hoc basis. Changes made do not consistently link to organisational needs and outcomes.

# [3.24.3](3.24.3.md)

Tools support efficient and effective outputs for high impact analytical processes. Efficiency and effectiveness of some lower priority outputs are still reduced due to inadequate tooling resources. Some tools may be disproportionately complex for the needs of the organisation.

# [3.25.3](3.25.3.md)

Tools for organising and accessing data are proportionate to the organisation’s needs and allow for registers of data assets to be maintained and updated.

Most data tools are up to date with support available. Work-arounds for inadequate tools to mitigate negative impacts on outcomes are not well communicated or understood.

# [3.29.3](3.29.3.md)

Data storage tools are beginning to be used that allow for broader, internal sharing across the organisation. Access to data for non-experts may require specialist support.

# [4.33.3](4.33.3.md)

Documents all critical and some important data sets in a central location, with a location of the data set. The data is available to those who need it through efficient, structured routes. Some data requires specialist support to access.

# [4.34.3](4.34.3.md)

# [7.69.3](7.69.3.md)

Monitors and enforces policies for data protection and data security consistently. Reviews policies regularly to ensure they are fit for current needs.

# [8.74.3](8.74.3.md)

All critical data assets have at least limited security and security governance in place. Security vetting of most staff is linked to data security.

# [8.75.3](8.75.3.md)

All data systems and tools integrate data security and are subject to risk assessments when changes are made. Bases access to systems and data on legitimate business needs.

# [8.82.3](8.82.3.md)

Standardised processes for recording IT assets are in place. Value and sensitivity of data stored in these assets is not consistently recorded.
