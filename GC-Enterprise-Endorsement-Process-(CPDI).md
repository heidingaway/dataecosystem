# GC Enterprise Endorsement Process (CPDI)
- The CPDI was created in 2023 from the merging of two active and productive communities: the [[Enterprise-Data-Community-of-Practice-(EDCOP)]] and the [[Information-Management-Leaders-Group]]. These working level groups created valuable products that had nowhere to go to be deemed enterprise. This [[governance]] process responds to that need.[^1]
- Note that there are multiple trigger points to initiate development of a solution:
	- Taskings may come from the [[Assistant-Deputy-Ministers-Committee-on-Data-and-Information-(ADM-CDI)]] or the [[Chief-Data-Officers-Council-(CDO-Council)-(CDOC)]]
    Â 
- A [[Working-Group]] may seek endorsement of a [[product]] it has developed on its own initiative.
